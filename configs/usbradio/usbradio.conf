			; Set to 1 for additonal gain if using a low-level receiver output

rxctcssrelax = 1	; reduce talkoff from radios w/o CTCSS Tx HPF
			; Do not change this, leave this as a 1 (default)

rxsqhyst = 3000         ; Setting Squelch Hysteresis

carrierfrom = dsp	; no,usb,usbinvert,dsp,vox 
			; no - no carrier detection at all
			; usb - from the COR line on the USB sound fob (Active high)

			; dsp - from RX noise using dsp techniques
			; vox - voice activated from RX audio

ctcssfrom = dsp		; no,usb,usbinvert,dsp
			; no - no CTCSS decoding, system will be carrier squelch
			; usb - from the CTCSS line on the USB sound fob (Active high)
			; usbinvert - from the inverted CTCSS line on the USB sound fob (Active low) 
			; dsp - CTCSS decoding using RX audio in DSP.
			; rxdemod option must be set to flat for this to work.

rxdemod = flat          ; input type from radio: no,speaker,flat
			; no - RX audio input not used
			; flat - Use RX audio from discriminator (before de-emphasis)
			; speaker - use de-emphasized audio 

rxsquelchdelay = 30	; delayline in ms carrier squelch tail eliminator 

rxondelay = 0           ; Number of 20mSec intervals following the release of PTT.
                        ; Uncomment and/or adjust for simplex nodes to eliminate "Ping Ponging"
                        ; or "Relay Racing". A positive value here will instruct the usbradio
                        ; driver to ignore the COR line for a specified number of 20mSec
                        ; intervals following the release of PTT. Use this ONLY on simplex
                        ; nodes, and leave commented out for repeaters or other full duplex nodes.

rxlpf = 0		; Receiver Audio Low Pass Filter 0,1 2 
			; 0 - 3.0 kHz cutoff (Default) value for reduced noise and increased intelligibility. (default)
			; 1 - 3.3 kHz cutoff for increased high end, sibilance and brightness.
			; 2 - 3.5 kHz cutoff for even more high end, sibilance and brightness.

rxhpf = 0		; Receiver Audio High Pass Filter 0,1 
			; 0 - 300 Hz cutoff. (Default) value to reduce sub-audible signals for retransmission and in the receiver speaker. (default)
			; 1 - 250 Hz cutoff for additional received and retransmitted bass response.
			; recommend using this filter with a CTCSS tone no higher than 186.2 Hz.

txboost = 0             ; Add transmitter audio gain boost: 0,1

txprelim = no		; Audio processing on left output channel: no,yes
			; no - Audio is not pre-emphasized and limited.

			; yes - Audio is pre-emphasized and limited.
			; Suitable for direct connection to an FM modulator

txlimonly = no		; Audio limiting with no pre-emphasis on output channel: no,yes
			; no - Audio is not limited. 
			; yes - Audio is  limited.
			; Suitable for transmitters with no limiting but with pre-emphasis.

txtoctype = phase	; Transmit tone control type: no,phase,notone
			; no - CTCSS tone encoding with no hang time
			; phase - encode CTCSS and reverse phase 
			; AKA ("reverse burst") before unkeying TX
			; notone - encode CTCSS and stop sending tone before unkeying TX
			; AKA ("chicken burst")

txmixa = voice		; Left channel output: no,voice,tone,composite,auxvoice
			; no - Do not output anything
			; voice - output voice only

txmixb = tone		; Right channel output: no,voice,tone,composite, auxvoice

txhpf = 0		; Transmitter Audio High Pass Filter 0,1,2
			; 0 - 300 Hz cutoff Reduce interference between voice and sub-audible signaling tones and codes (default)
			; 1 - 250 Hz cutoff Increase bass response in transmitted audio.
			; 2 - 120 Hz cutoff for special applications requiring additional bass response in transmitted audio
			; Not recommended due to the increased possibility of voice energy interfering with sub-audible signaling

invertptt = 0		; Invert PTT: 0,1 
			; 0 - ground to transmit (default)
			; 1 - open to transmit
			; This is the collector lead of the 2n4401 on the modified

			; please refer to the howto for the procedure to do this

duplex = 1		; Duplex 0,1
			; 0 - half duplex
			; 1 - full duplex

# Section for PCI Radio Interface
# (see http://www.zapatatelephony.org/app_rpt.html)

# The PCI Radio Interface card interfaces up to 4 two-way radios (either
# a base/mobile radio or repeater system) to Zaptel channels. The driver
# may work either independent of an application, or with it, through
# the driver;s ioctl() interface. This file gives you access to specify
# load-time parameters for Radio channels, so that the driver may run
# by itself, and just act like a generic Zaptel radio interface.

# Unlike the rest of this file, you specify a block of parameters, and
# then the channel(s) to which they apply. CTCSS is specified as a frequency
# in tenths of hertz, for example 131.8 HZ is specified as 1318. DCS
# for receive is specified as the code directly, for example 223. DCS for
# transmit is specified as D and then the code, for example D223.

# The hardware supports a "community" CTCSS decoder system that has
# arbitrary transmit CTCSS or DCS codes associated with them, unlike
# traditional "community" systems that encode the same tone they decode.


# from dhadi_cfg.c
# int rxtones[NUM_TONES + 1],rxtags[NUM_TONES + 1],txtones[NUM_TONES + 1];
# int bursttime = 0, debouncetime = 0, invertcor = 0, exttone = 0, corthresh = 0;
# int txgain = 0, rxgain = 0, deemp = 0, preemp = 0;

# txgain?
# rxgain?

# Note: By default, both rxgain and txgain are set at 0.
# You can increase the gain by using a positive number, and decrease it using a negative number.
# The numbers represent db (decibels), so a value of 4 would mean the gain is increased by 4 db.

# does not seem to apply to the pciradio card.


# this example is a single tone DCS transmit and receive

# tx = D371		# specify the transmit tone (in DCS mode this stays constant)

# dcsrx = 223		# specify the receive DCS code

# this example is a "community" CTCSS (if you only want a single tone, then
# only specify 1 in the ctcss list)

# tx = 1000		# specify the default transmit tone (when not receiving)

# ctcss = 1318,1,1318	# Specify the receive freq, the tag (use 0 if none), and the transmit code.
# ctcss = 1862,1,1862	# The tag may be used by applications to determine classification of tones.
# 			# The tones are to be specified in order of presedence, most important first.
# 			# Currently, 15 tones may be specified..

# The following parameters may be omitted if their default value is acceptible

# debouncetime = 123	# set the receive debounce time in milliseconds
# bursttime = 234	# set the transmit quiet dropoff burst time in milliseconds	

# corthresh = 12500	# set the COR level threshold (specified in tenths of millivolts)
# 			# valid values are {3125,6250,9375,12500,15625,18750,21875,25000}

# invertcor = y		# Invert COR signal {y,n}

# exttone = y		# set the external tone mode; yes, no, inverted external {y,n,i}
#			# High true External CTCSS on UIOB
#			# Low true External CTCSS on UIOB
#			# Use internal MX828 decoder on Quad Radio PCI card (not recommended)

# Now apply the configuration to the specified channels:

# channels = 1-4	# We are all done with our channel parameters, so now we specify what channels they apply to
